#Getting there, by transit

##From Mississauga/Milton/Brampton

The 25 GO bus connects UWaterloo to Milton and Square One, and departs hourly in both directions on Saturdays.

Take a local bus to Square One in time for the 6:10 and 7:10 AM route 25 buses to UWaterloo. The 25 departs from platform 6 at GO’s Square One Bus Terminal (located just north of MiWay’s City Centre Bus Terminal). The last stop of the 25 is UW’s Davis Centre. Volunteers and signs will be there to direct you to Mathematics 3, our venue for registration.

GO bus tickets can be bought from the ticket desk at Square One, as well as at the Student Life Centre on the UWaterloo campus. You can save on fares if you use a Presto card.

##From Toronto

You have two options: The Greyhound from Toronto Coach Terminal (at Bay and Dundas), or the GO from Union Station Bus Terminal (with a transfer at Square One).

<b>Greyhound option</b>
The first Greyhound bus bound for Kitchener leaves Toronto Coach Terminal at 7:00 AM. Get off at the last stop, Kitchener’s Charles St Terminal, and take one of GRT’s 7D, 7E or 200 (Conestoga Mall bound) buses. Get off at UW - B.C. Matthews Hall and walk to Mathematics 3 - there will be volunteers and signs along the way to guide you.


Greyhound tickets can be bought online, or at Toronto Coach Terminal. GRT fares can be paid in cash to the driver ($3).

<b>GO option</b>
Get to Union Station Bus Terminal, and take the 7:20 AM 21P GO bus heading to Meadowvale GO station. Get off at Square One, and transfer to the 8:10 AM GO 25 bus heading to UWaterloo. The UWaterloo stop is across the street from Engineering 5. Volunteers and signs will be there to direct you to Mathematics 3, our venue for registration.



Unfortunately, this option gets you to Tech Retreat by 10 AM, so try to avoid it unless it’s your only choice. For comparison, the Greyhound option gets you there by around 9:30 AM.

Tickets can be bought at Union Station Bus Terminal, as well as at Student Life Centre (SLC) on the UWaterloo campus. When buying a ticket, buy it for the whole journey (i.e. Union -> UWaterloo) rather than two separate ones (i.e. Union -> Square One and Square One -> Uwaterloo), since it is cheaper.

##From York Region (Markham/Vaughan/Richmond Hill)

Take a local bus to York University (or the Keele and Snidercroft GO bus stop near it). Take the GO 47G departing YorkU at 7:00 AM (and Keele/Snidercroft at 7:04 AM) heading towards Hamilton. Get off at Square One, and transfer to the 8:10 AM GO 25 bus heading to UWaterloo. Get off at the UWaterloo stop, which is located across the street from Engineering 5. Volunteers will be there to redirect you to Mathematics 3, our venue for registration.

Tickets can be purchased at the York University GO agent, as well as at the Student Life Centre (SLC) on the UWaterloo campus.

##From Guelph
The first Greyhound bus from Guelph to Kitchener leaves Guelph’s Greyhound terminal at 8:30 AM. Get off at Kitchener’s Charles Street Terminal, and ride either the 7D, 7E or 200 (Conestoga Mall) bound GRT buses to the UWaterloo campus. Then, get off at UW - B.C. Matthews Hall and walk to Mathematics 3 - there will be signs and volunteers along the path. 

Greyhound bus tickets can be purchased at Guelph’s Greyhound terminal, as well as at the Turnkey desk in the Student Life Centre on the UW campus. GRT fares can be paid in cash ($3) to the driver.
